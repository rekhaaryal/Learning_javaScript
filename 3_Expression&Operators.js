var myfavNum = 15;//= is assignment operator 
var myName ="Rekha";
// 2. arithmetic operator
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var sum = x + y; 
console.log(sum);
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var D = x - y; 
console.log(D);
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var M = x * y; 
console.log(M);
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var quotient = x / y; 
console.log(quotient);
// Modulus (%): Return the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.
var c = 17;
var d = 5;
var remainder = c % d;
console.log(remainder);
//*    interview Question
//? What will be the output
